Lab 2: AWS IoT connectivity
Introduction
In this lab, we will introduce our workshop case study and setup tools on your local Raspberry Pi 4 enable you to upload IoT data to cloud.

Workshop Case Study
Every team have been assigned a set of hardware, including a 4G Wi-Fi, a raspberry pi 4, a usb camera, a led light and a micro usb cable.

Step 1 
Try to locate your group's certifications, it should be *.crt and *.key. There are three of them.
	
Step 2 

Try to call IoT_core_init(url,port,root_cert,private_key,device_cert) 
in initialize_connectivity() in MCU.py

Step 3
Try to call transmit_message_to_cloud(mytopicheader, image_name, groupid, group_member_count, member_names,blessing, client)
in TransmitIoTData() in MCU.py

Step 4 Run MCU.py
