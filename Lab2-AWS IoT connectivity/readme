Lab 2: AWS IoT connectivity
Introduction
In this lab, we will introduce our workshop case study and setup tools on your local Raspberry Pi 4 enable you to upload IoT data to cloud.

Workshop Case Study
Every team have been assigned a set of hardware, including a 4G Wi-Fi, a raspberry pi 4, a usb camera, a led light and a micro usb cable.

Step 1 
Try to locate your group's certifications, it should be *.crt and *.key. There are three of them.

Step 2 
There are two API functions that you can use to transmit IoT device data to cloud
IoT_core_init(url,port,root_cert,private_key,device_cert)	
	1.This function should be called before any message to transmit

	2.This function takes 5 arguments：
		(1) url: the address that your IoT core, should be provided in IoT cloud document
		(2) port: the port that you connect to cloud, it should be provided in IoT cloud document
		(3) root_cert: it should be provided in IoT cloud document
		(4) private_key: it should be provided in IoT cloud document
		(5) devcie_cert: it should be provided in IoT cloud document

	3.Inside the IoT_core_init(), there is certification loading and submodule setup.

	4.It returns a client that you could use to transfer data via the channel.

transmit_message_to_cloud(mytopicheader, mypayload, client)
	1.This function is used to transmit message to IoT cloud.

	2.It takes two arguments mytopicheader and mypayload. 

	3.Mytopicheader is the format like “pg/{thingName}/data”

	4.Mypayload is the format of json.

	5.Client is the instance that you get from IoT_core_int()
