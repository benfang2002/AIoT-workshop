Lab 3: Lab3- Upload Picture To AWS S3
Introduction
In this lab, we will introduce our workshop case study and setup tools on your local Raspberry Pi 4 enable you to upload image data to cloud.

Workshop Case Study
Every team have been assigned a set of hardware, including a 4G Wi-Fi, a raspberry pi 4, a usb camera, a led light and a micro usb cable.

Step 1 
Try to locate your group's key, it should be in two parts: access key and secret key.

Step 2 
There are two API functions that you can use to transmit IoT device data to cloud
s3_init()	
	1.S3 is the file server that we need to upload our face recognition image which is your face!! 

	2.S3 is a different server from IoT core data server, do not confuse with them. They are physically different.

	3.S3_init() is the function you need to called at first if you want to upload a image to s3 server.

	4.It returns a client that you need for next step


s3_upload(filepath, group, year, month, date, name, client)
	1.s3_upload(filepath, group, year, month, date, name) is used to transmit image data to AWS s3 server.

	2.It takes arguments:
		Filepath: the image path in your device.
		Group: which group you are in
		Year: which year your time zone
		Month: which month your time zone
		Date: which date your time zone
		Name: the name that you want it be in server, it could be different from your localâ€™s filename
		Client is the instance that you get from s3_init()
